description: Using SQL databases (SQLite/Turso) for persistent conversation storage in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System
---

SQL storage provides a flexible and reliable solution for storing conversation history in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System. This implementation supports both local SQLite databases and remote Turso databases, making it suitable for various deployment scenarios from development to production.

## Features

- Persistent storage across application restarts
- Support for both local and remote databases
- Built-in connection pooling and retry mechanisms
- Compatible with edge and serverless deployments
- Transaction support for data consistency
- Efficient indexing for quick data retrieval

## When to Use SQL Storage

- When you need a balance between simplicity and scalability
- For applications requiring persistent storage without complex infrastructure
- In both development and production environments
- When working with edge or serverless deployments
- When you need local-first development with remote deployment options

## Python Package Installation

To use SQL storage in your Python application, make sure to install them:

```bash
pip install "multi-agent-orchestrator[sql]"
```

This will install the `libsql-client` package required for SQL storage functionality.

## Implementation

To use SQL storage in your Multi-Agent Orchestrator:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript" color="blue">
    ```typescript
    import { SqlChatStorage, MultiAgentOrchestrator } from 'multi-agent-orchestrator';

    // For local SQLite database
    const localStorage = new SqlChatStorage('file:local.db');
    await localStorage.waitForInitialization();

    // For remote database
    const remoteStorage = new SqlChatStorage(
      'libsql://your-database-url.example.com',
      'your-auth-token'
    );
    await remoteStorage.waitForInitialization();

    const orchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator({
      storage: localStorage // or remoteStorage
    });


    // Close the database connections when done
    await localStorage.close();
    await remoteStorage.close();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    ```python
    from multi_agent_orchestrator.storage import SqlChatStorage
    from multi_agent_orchestrator.orchestrator import MultiAgentOrchestrator

    # For local SQLite database
    local_storage = SqlChatStorage('file:local.db')

    # For remote Turso database
    remote_storage = SqlChatStorage(
      url='libsql://your-database-url.turso.io',
      auth_token='your-auth-token'
    )

    orchestrator = MultiAgentOrchestrator(storage=local_storage)  # or remote_storage
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

### Local DB
For local development, simply provide a file URL:
```typescript
const storage = new SqlChatStorage('file:local.db');
```

### Remote DB
For production with Turso:
1. Create a Turso database through their platform
2. Obtain your database URL and authentication token
3. Configure your storage:
```typescript
const storage = new SqlChatStorage(
  'libsql://your-database-url.com',
  'your-auth-token'
);
```

## Database Schema

The SQL storage implementation uses the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  message_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, session_id, agent_id, message_index)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_lookup 
ON conversations(user_id, session_id, agent_id);
```

## Considerations

- Automatic table and index creation on initialization
- Built-in transaction support for data consistency
- Efficient query performance through proper indexing
- Support for message history size limits
- Automatic JSON serialization/deserialization of message content

## Best Practices

- Use a single instance of SqlChatStorage throughout your application
- Regularly backup your database
- Implement data cleanup strategies for old conversations
- Monitor database size and performance
- Keep your authentication tokens secure
- Implement proper access controls at the application level
- Close the database connections when done

SQL storage provides a robust and flexible solution for managing conversation history in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System. It offers a good balance between simplicity and features, making it suitable for both development and production environments.
